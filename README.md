# QR-Clock
is a simple and powerfull application where we can know what time it is at any time through a qr code, 
which updates every 1000ms, 
to provide you with a code that is always different with the current time! 
# Cool!

# (Okay, you could always check the time anywhere on your computer, but it's cool to scan QR codes, isn't it?)

# DESKTOP MODE

To develop this SIMPLE application I used Vite / Vanilla JS and imported https://www.npmjs.com/package/qrcode.
